# PHT Exoplanet Candidates

Data and notebook for generating plots to examine the population of PHT planet candidates.

**Figure 1.** The PHT planet candidates (magenta squares) compared to the automated pipeline found candidates (blue dots), highlighting the different region of parameter space filled in by the two different search methods. Values of the orbital periods and planet radii were obtained via transit modelling using the open source software *pyaneti* (Barragan et al [2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14086), [GitHub](https://github.com/oscaribv/pyaneti)) The orbital period of single transit events are poorly constrained, which is reflected by the large errorbars.

**Figure 2.** Stellar evolution tracks showing main sequence (solid black lines) and post-main sequence (dashed grey lines) MIST stellar evolution for stellar masses ranging from 0.3 to 1.6 solar mass in steps of 0.1 solar mass. The magenta evololution track shows corresponds to 1 Solar mass. The navy dots show the TOIs and the magenta circles show the PHT candidates. This figure highlights that PHT is able to find planet candidates around stars with a wide range of properties as well as at different stages of their evololution.
